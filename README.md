# Multi-Layer Perceptron with back-propogation network

This project is to build a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) back-propagation network style of artificial neural network classifier. The project has a Classified Set of feature vectors with more than 2 possible classes. The Training Set is a percentage of those vectors. A single MLP has been constructed with one hidden layer and one multi-class output layer.

## Output
The project will output:
1) The MLP architecture, including initial weights, final weights, and how many epochs you required for the training. 
2) The accuracy and various rate results of the final MLP on each of the Holdout vectors, and on the Validation Set.
